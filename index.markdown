# Welcome to AIM-HEALTH!

The AIM-HEALTH initiative aim to foster a vibrant and collaborative network of interdisciplinary researchers across Norway and internationally.
At its core, it unites **leading medical research institutions, university hospitals, and AI research groups** within a **national node network**.
This network is structured around **four Regional Nodes** that connect researchers to regional hospitals and healthcare infrastructure providers, promoting synergies between the research and healthcare systems.

The initiative brings together a **multidisciplinary team** of experts with **complementary expertise**, including AI researchers, data scientists, clinicians, legal experts, and social scientists.
This diverse group collaborates across work packages and core support units.

Beyond the formal structure, the network includes:

*   **AI expert hubs** integrated with the health data node network.
*   Strong collaborations between **academia and industry partners**, including SMEs and large companies, facilitated through sandbox environments and networking events.
*   Engagement with **international frontline AI research institutes** and Nordic partners for knowledge exchange and federated data access.

This informal network is crucial for AIM-HEALTH's interdisciplinary approach, enabling the seamless integration of AI innovation with real-world healthcare challenges and fostering a strong community dedicated to advancing healthcare through AI.
